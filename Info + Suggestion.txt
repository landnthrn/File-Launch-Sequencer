A Windows batch script and command prompt UI that let's you create, save, and run customized auto open sequences

Main Purposes: 

Open a sequence of files or applications automatically

Opening project files for software that allows you to have multiple projects open at once, 
but doesn't allow you to actually open multiple projects at once. 
This will automate having to open project files individually. 

Can be useful for other various tasks

Features:
— Scan a folder by file extension or paste file paths directly
— Choose folder scan depth: All Subfolders, First-Level Subfolders Only, or Target Folder Only
— Use exclusion filters to skip specific folders path(s), folder name(s), or keywords in filenames
— Set configurable delays to prevent system overload from opening many files at once (also very useful for giving large programs time to launch like editing software...etc..) 
— Works with any file type your system can open
— Save presets to quickly reuse later
— Preview & edit presets inside the UI or by editing .json files
