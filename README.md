# File Launch Sequencer

**A Windows batch script and Command Prompt UI that let's you create, save, run customized auto open sequences** 

## Main Purposes: 
Open a sequence of files or applications automatically

Opening project files for software that allows you to have multiple projects open at once, 
but doesn't allow you to actually open multiple projects at once. 
This can automate having to open project files individually. 

Can be useful for other various tasks

### What it do?
- Scan folder(s) for the target format(s) or paste file paths directly
- Use exclusion filters to skip specific folders path(s), folder name(s), or keywords in filenames
- Set configurable delays to prevent system overload from opening many files at once  
  *(also very useful for giving large programs time to launch like editing software...etc..)* 
- Works with any file type your system can open
- Save presets to reuse later
- Preview & edit presets inside the UI or by editing .json files
